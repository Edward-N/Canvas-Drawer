# Canvas-Drawer

In the following program, the user is prompted with a canvas drawer GUI. The GUI enables the user to draw shapes, clear the canvas, reset the canvas, remove specific items from the previous list of shapes chosen (list shape history), clear all function (clears the canvas, reset all settings to default and clears the list of pervious shapes chosen).
The GUI contains the following:
1. Different shapes the user can use to draw by clicking on the button </br>
2. Use the fill dropdown menu to fill in the color of the shape with the primary colors </br>
3. Reset Button to clear the canvas, but the last shape and color fill-in option is still set </br> 
4. Clear Button to clear the canvas and the previous setting including shape and color fill-in option </br>
5. Remove button, allows the user to remove specific shapes from the list that are actively populated when a shape is drawn. To further elaborate, when a shape is drawn the coordinates of where the shape was drawn is stored on a list that is presented to the user on the left side of the canvas GUI. The user can then remove items by clicking on them and pressing remove. If the last element is chosen and removed it will clear the canvas since it is the current shape present on the canvas. </br>
6. Clear all, removes the current shape from the canvas, resets all settings to default, clears the list shape history. </br>
